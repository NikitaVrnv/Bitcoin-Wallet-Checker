# Bitcoin Wallet Checker

This Python script generates random Bitcoin wallet addresses (using BIP39 mnemonics) and checks their balances on the blockchain using public APIs.

**Important: This tool is for educational purposes only. It is NOT a tool for finding active Bitcoin wallets with balances. The likelihood of finding a wallet with a positive balance through random generation is EXTREMELY low.**

## Disclaimer

This script is provided for informational and educational purposes only. By using this script, you agree to the following:

*   **No Guarantee of Finding Balances:** The script does NOT guarantee that you will find a Bitcoin wallet with a balance. The Bitcoin address space is vast, and the odds of randomly finding an address with a balance are astronomically small.
*   **Ethical Use:** You are responsible for using this script ethically and legally. Do not use it for any malicious purposes, such as attempting to access wallets that do not belong to you.
*   **No Liability:** The author(s) of this script are not responsible for any damages or losses you may incur from using this script.
*   **Private Key Security:** The private keys and mnemonic phrases generated by this script must be kept secret and secure. If you lose control of these, you may lose control of any funds associated with them.
*   **API Reliability:** The script relies on public APIs for checking balances. These APIs may have rate limits, downtime, or may change without notice, which can affect the script's functionality.
*   **Educational Purposes:** This tool was created to help users understand the basics of Bitcoin address generation and to illustrate that finding Bitcoin wallets through brute force is impossible.
*   **Do Not Use for Financial Gain:** This script is not intended for financial gain. Do not rely on this script for any financial decisions or for the purpose of stealing funds.

**By using this script, you acknowledge that you have read and understand the disclaimer.**

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you have a repository):
    ```bash
    https://github.com/NikitaVrnv/Bitcoin-Wallet-Checker
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    *   On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
4.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip3 install mnemonic ecdsa bitcoin requests aiohttp
    ```
5.  **Save the python script:**
    Save the python script into a file called `bitcoin_checker.py`.

## Usage

1.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python3 bitcoin_checker.py
    ```
2.  **Monitor the output:** The script will generate and check bitcoin wallets and their balances at a specific interval.
3.  **Stop the script:** Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the script.
4.  **Output:** Wallet information and balances will be printed to the terminal, and wallets with a positive balance will be saved into the `found_wallets.txt` file.

## Script Details

*   The script uses the `mnemonic` library to generate BIP39 mnemonic seed phrases.
*   It derives private keys from the mnemonics using `ecdsa` and `bitcoin` libraries.
*   It generates Bitcoin addresses using the `bitcoin` library.
*   It checks wallet balances using the Blockcypher and Blockstream APIs (as a fallback).
*   It uses `asyncio` and `aiohttp` for concurrent API requests to improve performance.

## Customization

*   **`API_CALL_INTERVAL`:** You can adjust how often you check for a balance. A lower number will check more wallets, but may hit API rate limits.
*   **`MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS`:** You can adjust how many concurrent requests the script can make. A higher number may improve performance but may also cause your system to become unstable if you don't have enough resources.
*   **`output_file`:** You can change the name of the file that will contain wallets with positive balances.
